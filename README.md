# Restoration of the Tully-Fisher Relation with the Lucy 1974 Rectification Algorithm

***H. Fu, December 2023***

This repository accompanies the journal article *Restoration of the
Tully-Fisher Relation by Statistical Rectification*, submitted to the
Astrophysical Journal Letters in Dec 2023. Here I provide the merged
ALFALFA-SDSS galaxy catalog (`ALFALFA_SDSS_merged.csv`), a Jupyter 
notebook that implements the Lucy 1974 rectification algorithm 
(`TFR.ipynb`), another notebook that illustrate the result at the last 
iteration (`TFR_plot.ipynb`), along with the preprint article
(`Fu24.pdf`).
