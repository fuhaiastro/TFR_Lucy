# Restoration of the Tully-Fisher Relation with the Lucy 1974 Rectification Algorithm

This repository accompanies the journal article *Restoration of the Tully-Fisher Relation by Statistical Rectification*, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters in Dec 2023. Here I provide the merged ALFALFA-SDSS galaxy catalog, a Jupyter notebook that implements the Lucy 1974 rectification algorithm, and notebooks that illustrate the result.
