# Restoration of the Tully-Fisher Relation with the Lucy Rectification Algorithm

*H. Fu, February 2024*

This repository accompanies the *Astrophysical Journal Letter*: [Restoration of the
Tully-Fisher Relation by Statistical
Rectification](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...963L..19F/abstract).

In the main folder I provide the merged ALFALFA-SDSS galaxy catalog
(`ALFALFA_SDSS_merged.csv`), a Python notebook that implements the Lucy
rectification algorithm (`TFR.ipynb`), another Python notebook that
illustrate the result at the last iteration (`TFR_plot.ipynb`), along
with the preprint article (`2401.13738.pdf`). 

The subfolder `xsig20.0_ysig0.14_w30` contains the data files and the
figures generated by the Python notebooks and the folder name indicates
the values of the key parameters in the joint probability density
function.
